Rules;
* 5 Out: Take notice of where your teammates are, fill in empty space/lanes.
* Move with Purpose: Lazy movement will slow down the offense and will find you riding the bench (harsh?)
* Space: Similar to #1, if there’s an action on the opposite side dont clog the lane by unnecessarily cutting or running towards the action
* Pace: Its okay to stand still while offense gets set, we dont need constant movement 24/7 to be effective, be mindful of this
* Advantages: They only last a couple seconds, learn to recognize them and when to attack
* Trust the System: We will do our best to put you in advantageous spots, trust the actions we run and most importantly trust your teammates. Basketball is 5v5 and we won't succeed without some element of trust within the team.
